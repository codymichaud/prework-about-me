      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Diesel Technician looking for a new start.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Snohomish, Washington</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love turning wrenches and modifying cars. I have also found an interest in the outdoors recently.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be to run my own business creating websites for businnesses, as well as creating e-commerce websites.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Cheney, Washington.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a Web developer because coding and computers has always interested me since I was a teenager. Unfortunately it got pushed on the back burner when I really started getting into modifying cars. I was recently let go due to Covid and because of this I have seen how much being a Diesel Technician has destroyed my body. It has also rekindled my love for computers and coding. </p>
